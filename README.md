# my-code-shared-in-cv
This is python code that I created for my personal projects.

The purpose of this python code is to check the prices for group of stocks on daily basis and detect a buy signal.

This code will get prices of a certain group of selected stocks and will determine if the condition for buy signal is met or not.
If the condition is met, this code will send email notification to users using email marketing API.
